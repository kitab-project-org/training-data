### Repository for the KITAB text reuse Hackathon

Here are the texts found in Evaluation-Hackathon as of 4/12 with aligned spans marked with @ALIGN@B@id#@ and @ALIGN@E@id#@ at the beginning and end of the alignment, respectively.

The alignments were created by aligning the pages of the two texts of a pair in isolation (i.e. without the rest of the corpus as input. As a result of the page level alignment, you may see some alignments that should cross page boundaries that don't. This is expected, but should be corrected if it occurs in a section you choose to annotate.

In each folder, you will also find a CSV of the aligned sections by id number, which is useful for finding issues in the process of inserting markers but should be relevant to annotation.

Please not that when you annotate texts, you should record which lines you annotated in EvaluationLocations in this directory's parent directory (or a similarly formatted file.)
