Annotation record file changes:

 "JK000001" in the text_1 field of the alignment annotation file 
  had one too few 0.

 Merged the tagged extants in Mathew and Gowaart's
  annotations into one line in the json for the pair JK000911_JK001330

 Line 15715 in Shamela0011680 with an end tag wasn't marked
  as tagged despite having a manual opening tag on it
 
 Line 6743 in text Shamela0011780 with an end tag wasn't marked
  as tagged despite having a manual end tag on it

Individual text pair notes:

 0730ShaficIbnCali.HusnManaqib.LMN20200820-ara1.completed contains
  two start points for alignment 45. The second (line 3513) has
  been replaced with an end tag

 An end tag on line 9692 in text JK000001 was missing the final @ sign

 @ALB@145001@ was mistyped as @145001@ALB@ on line 102430 of JK000911.
  Might be a text order issue? Unclear exactly what happened. Perhaps
  check if the marker is still in the right place.

Notes on JK001259-ara1_Shamela0002864-ara1:

 Removed an end tag from line 39 of JK001259 that was technically
  from the alignment of the first section with metadata
 
 Missing @ added to the beginning tag of alignment 210 of JK001259
  (line 59)
 
 @ALB@150@ mistyped as @150@ALB@ on line 73 of JK001259

 @ALB@267@ mistyped as @267@ALB@ on line 233 of JK001259

 @ALB@89@ mistyped as @89@ALB@ on line 306 of JK001259

 @ALB@64@ mistyped as @64@ALB@ on line 324 of JK001259

 Removed automatic alignment tags @ALIGN@B/E@184@ as it was in the
  middle of a human tag, making the human tag unreadable 
  (questionable decision)

 @ALB@106001@ mistyped as @106001@ALB@ on line 755 of JK001259
 
 Removed extraneous space in @ALE@ 106001@ and converted extra end tag
  to begin tag on line 15236 of Shamela0002864

 A lot of these tags are backwards. 
  Possibly a word order issue with combined English and Arabic text orders.
  Regexes to fix:
  Find:    @(\d+)@ALE@   @(\d+)@ALB@ 
  Replace: @ALE@\1@      @ALB@\1@
 Edit: this fixed some but not all issues. 
 
 Second @ALB@106@ tag in Shamela0002864 converted to end tag on line 15236.

 Despite these changes, the end tags for 19 alignments in the pair
  JK001259-ara1_Shamela0002864-ara1 are missing endpoints in at least one
  text. My guess is that there's a word order issue with the tags. Does
  someone else want to give this a look?
 
 Duplicate @ALB@103001@ on line 288 of JK001259 replace with @ALE@103001@
  I may have changed too much on line 288 of that file. There was an
  automatic tag throwing off the manual tags, so I had to remove an
  auto-tag. Someone might want to give that a look?
 
 Why is alignment 221 still automatic tags? It seems to be in
  evaluated regions in both texts in JK001259-ara1_Shamela0002864-ara1

 First instance of @ALE@76001@ replaced with begin tag on line 1594`
  in Shamela0002864-ara1.
 
 Odd. I got 70 alignments from that pair with only 38 @ALB@ tags. 
  Were some evaluated alignments left in the automatic tags?
 
Tabari-Tayfur

 Half the alignments (0005-0008)in Tabari appear outside
  the annotated region, with the last annotated line being 
  108681 and alignment 5 appearing on line 108693. Were some 
  annotation markers forgotten? The corresponding alignment in
  Ibn Tayfur is on line 1715 while the last tagged line is 741.
 
Shamela11680-Shamela11780

 Removed end tag of opening alignment in Shamela0011680
  since it doesn't technically count due to being in the metadata

 Replaced @ALB@7100.@ with @ALB@71003@ on line 241 in Shamela0011780
