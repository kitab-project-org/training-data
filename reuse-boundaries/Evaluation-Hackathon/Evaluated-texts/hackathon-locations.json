  "comments": "lines in b1 are often very long, as they are full paragraphs - hence the big differences between line ranges evaluated between b1 and b2; alignment 27 is a heavily rearranged list of names and functions, followed by a more faithfully copied poem; I have consolidated continuous alignments into one long alignment, in most cases these are documents or poetry that are copied verbatim from b1 to b2; I think generally passim catches b2's heavy reworking in cases where it is followed or following a verbatim quoted document, but discards other passages that may share some words but which have been heavily edited in b2"
